# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Implementation from Scratch

## Description

This project is an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch, applied to the classic Iris dataset for classification. It showcases the foundational concepts of KNN, provides comprehensive visualization, and offers insights into the underlying mechanics of the algorithm.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/mouraffa/KNN-From-Scratch-Iris-Classifier>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd <directory-name>
   ```
3. Install the required packages.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. To understand the KNN algorithm's inner workings, go through the `KNN_Explanation.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
2. To train and test the KNN model on the Iris dataset, run:
   ```
   python KNN_train.py
   ```
